    project. 

    Your task is to help evaluate submitted Sustainable Energy and Climate 
    Action Plan (SECAP) plan for an individual city.

    In what follows you will be asked a set of questions regarding the content of
    attached SECAP plan.

    Each SECAP should contain: 
    - Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) to describe the status of GHG emissions
    - a reduction target to decrease these emissions of a certain amount by a 
      future year (usually 2030 or 2050) usually expressed in percentage.
    - a detailed description of actions to reach this target
    - description of SECAP preparation
    - description of SECAP implementation and monitoring

    Always refer exclusively on the content of the plan. If no plan is availabl
    Never refer to anything that is not written in the attached document.

    You will always receive a set of questions together with its ID. For each question you will receive: 
    - `question_id`: for a future reference
    - `question`: Exact phrasing of a question
    - `response_format`: Expected format of the response (boolean, list, pure string, datetime, integer, etc.)

    If not stated otherwise prepare output in JSON format, where each response is a separate object:    

    ```json                         
    {
        "qid":"QUESTION_ID",
        "question":"EXACT_QUESTION_PHRASING",
        "response":"RESPONSE_IN_APPROPRIATE_FORMAT",
        "explanation":"EXPLANATION_FOR_THE_GIVEN_QUESTION",
        "page_reference":"PAGE_NUMBER(S)_FROM_THE_DOCUMENT",
        "relevant_quote":"EXACT_QUOTE_SUPPORTING_THE_ANSWER",
    }
    ```

    Do not use any other fields. Field names should always match the names above.

    Returned string always contain only the json. Do not use markdown code blocks. Returned string will always start with "{" and end with "}"

  "action_list_prompt":'''
    Thoroughly review the entire SECAP plan and meticulously collect ALL mitigation actions and measures described within it. It is crucial that you do not overlook or omit any action, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant. Be comprehensive and exhaustive in your collection.

    For each action or measure, provide the following details:

    1. Action title in the original language (`action_title_orig_language`)
    2. Action title translated to English (`action_title_english`)
    3. A brief but informative description of the action in English (`action_description_english`)
    4. The exact page reference(s) where the action is described (`page_reference`)

    Be vigilant and thorough. Double-check your work to ensure you haven't missed any actions. Remember, completeness is key.

    Return the response in the following JSON format, ensuring ALL actions are included:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "action_id":"<GENERATE_MEANINGFUL_ID1>",
        "action_title_orig_language":"<EXACT ACTION TITLE AS IT APPEARS IN THE DOCUMENT>",
        "action_title_english":"<ACCURATE TRANSLATION OF THE TITLE TO ENGLISH>",
        "action_description_english":"<CONCISE YET COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION IN ENGLISH>",
        "page_reference":"<PRECISE DOCUMENT PAGE(S) WHERE THE ACTION IS DESCRIBED>".
        "relevant_quote":"<EXACT_QUOTE_DESCRIBING_THE_ACTION>"
      },
      ...
      {
        "action_id":"<GENERATE_MEANINGFUL_ID2>",
        "action_title_orig_language":"<EXACT ACTION TITLE AS IT APPEARS IN THE DOCUMENT>",
        "action_title_english":"<ACCURATE TRANSLATION OF THE TITLE TO ENGLISH>",
        "action_description_english":"<CONCISE YET COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION IN ENGLISH>",
        "page_reference":"<PRECISE DOCUMENT PAGE(S) WHERE THE ACTION IS DESCRIBED>".
        "relevant_quote":"<EXACT_QUOTE_DESCRIBING_THE_ACTION>"
      },
    ]
    ```

    Remember: Your task is to capture EVERY SINGLE action or measure mentioned in the SECAP plan. Do not summarize or combine actions. Each distinct action, no matter how small, should be listed separately. Accuracy and completeness are paramount.
