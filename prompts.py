    Full SECAP plan:

    {documents}

    Thoroughly review the entire SECAP plan above and meticulously collect ALL mitigation actions and measures described within it.

    Extract all formally defined mitigation actions and measures that meet at least one of these criteria:
    - Listed under dedicated "Actions" or "Measures" sections
    - Often they have a distinct identifier or reference number
    - Contains specific targets, timelines, or resource allocations
    - Formally labeled as an action/measure/initiative
     
    Be vigilant and thorough. Double-check your work to ensure you haven't missed any actions. Remember, completeness is key.

    For each action return only basic set of information:
    - Action title both in original language of the plan and in English
    - Basic description of the action
    - page reference

    Remember: Your task is to capture EVERY SINGLE action or measure mentioned in the SECAP plan. Do not summarize or combine actions. Each distinct action, no matter how small, should be listed separately. Accuracy and completeness are paramount.

  "action_details": '''
I will provide you with an action title from the SECAP plan and you will some details:

    1. Action title in the original language (`action_title_orig_language`)
    2. Action title translated to English (`action_title_english`)
    3. A brief but informative description of the action in English (`action_description_english`)
    4. The exact page reference(s) where the action is described (`page_reference`)


You should also assign it to a set  of predefined categories. Also add details regarding the action impact 
and implementation in English (translate from the description in the document).

  "action_SMART": '''
The SMART criteria are often used to assess the efficient goal setting. 
Good objectives or goals should be SMART - Specific, Measurable, Assignable,
Realistic, and Time-bound.

Your task is to evaluate the SMARTness of the following action.

# Action Title: {action}

## Candidate documents describing the action: {candidates}

## SMART Criteria:

    **Specific (S)**: Clear, concise, and well-defined
    **Measurable (M)**: Quantifiable outcome with trackable progress
    **Achievable (A)**: Realistic and attainable with available resources and constraints
    **Relevant (R)**: Aligned with the overall goal and objective of the plan
    **Time-bound (T)**: Specific deadline or timeframe for completion

Using the SMART criteria, please provide a `score` for each letter 
(`S`, `M`, `A`, `R`, `T`) on a scale of 0-1, where 0 indicates the action does 
not meet the criteria and 1 indicates the action fully meets the criteria.
For each letter also add a very brief `explanation` of evaluation.

Evaluation Guidelines:

    Consider the action's clarity, concision, and definition
    Assess the action's measurability, including quantifiable outcomes and trackable progress
    Evaluate the action's achievability, including available resources and constraints
    Determine the action's relevance to the overall goal and objective of the plan
    Assess the action's time-bound nature, including specific deadlines or timeframes

"barriers_prompt":'''

    Context: Below are relevant excerpts from a Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP).
    {candidates}
    
    Task: Analyze these excerpts and identify only explicitly stated barriers that affect the overall implementation 
    of the SECAP or achievement of emission reduction targets. 
    
    A barrier should be something that:
    1. Impedes the implementation of multiple actions or the plan as a whole
    2. Is clearly described using terms like "barrier", "challenge", "weakness", "lack of", etc.
    3. Is presented as a current or anticipated obstacle, not a hypothetical one
    
    If no clear barriers meeting these criteria are found, do not return any.

  - Include only concrete, implemented processes (not planned/proposed)
  - Quote relevant text as evidence

  2. Citizen Input Mechanisms
  - List specific tools/methods used to gather citizen input
  - Quote relevant text as evidence

  3. Stakeholder Groups

  Do not infer or extrapolate beyond what is explicitly stated in the text. 
  Only include information that is directly supported by the excerpts.
