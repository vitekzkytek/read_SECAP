In other words, it's not sufficient to simply mention a sector in the plan; we need to determine if its emissions are quantitatively accounted for in the BEI and, subsequently, used to set a specific reduction target.\nSpecifically, address the following questions:\n1. Which sectors are explicitly mentioned in the plan, but do not have their emission inventories included in the BEI or used to set a reduction target?\n2. Are there any sectors whose emission inventories are included in the BEI, but are not clearly linked to a specific reduction target or action plan?\n3. How transparent is the SECAP document in distinguishing between sectors that are merely mentioned and those that have their emission inventories actively used to inform the emission reduction target?\nBy focusing on this critical distinction, provide an assessment of the SECAP document's effectiveness in using baseline emission inventories to set meaningful emission reduction targets. If the city uses multiple BEI estimates, consider only the most up-to-date\n\n",
